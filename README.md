Small classification example with tensorflow
==========================

This is basic example of the use of Tensorflow to implement a 3 layer neural network which classifies 2D points.

The goal is to implement one neural network as shown in http://playground.tensorflow.org/. I just re-implement the network, the interface is not re-implemented, neither are the controls for all parameters.
